Build a fully implemented SDL application where a little 16 bit SDL pixel art 3/4 generated knight meets a little pixel art wizard walks around an ever expanding maze algorithm generated dungeon where he's given a quest to find a treasure and defeat a dragon at the end. Level should be kept track of in a bar at the bottom and top left should be HP. You should get potions randomly as drops from fighting monsters which should randomly appear and be chosen from a generated set of pixel art at the beginning each of which are pre assigned attack and defense range values out of which their attack and defense is chosen st beginning of combat. Also add anything else you can think of. Use no placeholders or TODOs and think of any other features to add or optimize the game. Organize it efficiently and include whatever headers and Makefile and whatever else. Make sure it can compile on MacOS. Add some synthesized background music also. And a title screen.

Since a knight's quest is a well known taken game title come up with something unique for a title for this game

You're absolutely right! Let me give this game a unique and memorable title. How about **"Dragon's Labyrinth"** - it captures the maze exploration and the ultimate dragon boss encounter perfectly.

Let me update the game files with this new title:

Perfect! I've renamed the game to **"Dragon's Labyrinth"** - a much more unique and evocative title that captures the essence of navigating through maze-like dungeons to face the ultimate dragon boss.

## üêâ The New Title: "Dragon's Labyrinth"

This title is unique and perfectly captures the game's core mechanics:
- **Dragon**: The ultimate boss and end goal
- **Labyrinth**: The procedurally generated maze dungeons
- Together they create an immediate sense of adventure and challenge

## Updated Project Details:

**New executable name**: `dragons_labyrinth`
**Updated throughout**: All references in code, documentation, build scripts, and setup files

## Quick Start with New Title:
```bash
# Automated setup
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh

# Manual build and run  
make run
# or
make all && ./dragons_labyrinth
```

The game now has a distinctive, memorable title that stands out from generic "Knight's Quest" titles while maintaining the medieval fantasy theme. "Dragon's Labyrinth" immediately conveys the core gameplay loop: navigate the labyrinth, defeat the dragon, claim victory!

All files have been updated consistently with the new branding, making this a truly unique dungeon crawler experience. üéÆ‚öîÔ∏èüê≤

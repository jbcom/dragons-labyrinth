# Dragon's Labyrinth - Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Project files have been successfully reorganized. Ready for building and testing.

## Recent Changes
- Created memory bank structure for the Dragon's Labyrinth project
- Initialized core memory bank files based on project documentation
- Project title was changed from "Knight's Quest" to "Dragon's Labyrinth" for uniqueness
- Successfully renamed all project files to their correct names
- Removed duplicate project_structure.txt.txt file

## Next Steps
1. Test build process with `make all`
2. Run the game with `./dragons_labyrinth`
3. Document any build or runtime issues
4. Update progress.md with build/test results

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### File Naming Issues (Resolved)
All files have been successfully renamed:
- `Audio_System_(audio.c).c` → ✅ `audio.c`
- `Combat_System_(combat.c).c` → ✅ `combat.c`
- `Game_Header_(game.h).c` → ✅ `game.h`
- `Main_Game_(main.c).c` → ✅ `main.c`
- `MakefileMakefile` → ✅ `Makefile`
- `Maze_Generation_(maze.c).c` → ✅ `maze.c`
- `README.md.md` → ✅ `README.md`
- `setup.sh.sh` → ✅ `setup.sh`
- `Sprites_Generation_(sprites.c).c` → ✅ `sprites.c`
- `User_Interface_(ui.c).c` → ✅ `ui.c`
- `project_structure.txt.txt` → ✅ Removed (duplicate content)

### Project Structure
All source files should remain in the root directory as per the original design.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Modular architecture with separate C files for each system
- All assets (sprites, audio) generated procedurally - no external files
- SDL2-based rendering using surfaces (not renderer)
- macOS as primary target platform

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Game was originally named "Knight's Quest" but renamed to "Dragon's Labyrinth" for uniqueness
- Complete implementation includes all requested features:
  - 16-bit pixel art sprites
  - Procedural maze generation
  - Turn-based combat
  - RPG progression system
  - Synthesized audio
  - Title screen and UI elements
- Project demonstrates clean SDL2 game architecture without external dependencies
